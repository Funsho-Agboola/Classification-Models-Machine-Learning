# Classification-Models-Machine-Learning

## Here, Machine Learning Classifiers are trained to:
- learn the relationship of different datasets and 
- evaluating how well they have come to also learn the data

## The onlly Dataset the Models trained on here is:

- 50_Startups.csv
- Position_Salaries.csv
- Salary_Data.csv

### The reason to that is so we would be able to run the following:

- To calculate the Confusion Matrix, and
- To also derive our accuracy score

And then will we conclude on the best Classifier that learns the relationship of the particular dataset and should be used for it.

## Also take note that Data preprocessing has been taken into consideration before training or Models and finally evaluating them.

- You could find how to work on the preprocessing (i.e cleaning up missing data, address categorical data, split data and applying feature scaling) in the Data-Preprocessing repository.
